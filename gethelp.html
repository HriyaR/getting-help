   <h1>How can you help yourself</h1> 
   <br>
   <h2>Tell the people around you</h2><br>
   <h3>It may be awkward or embarrasing at first, but this one step can make a huge difference in your recovery. <br>
    You could also talk to someone online at <a href="https://mystruggles.in/talk">MyStruggles</a></h3>
<br>
    <h2>Join an eating disorder support group</h2><br>
    <h3>Connecting with other going through the same things as you can help you look at things from a fresh perspective. It also provides motivation for you to try harder.</h3>
<br>
    <h2>Develop a balanced relationship with food</h2> <br>
    <h3>Eat when you are truly hungry. Don't restrict your food intake or diet, an occasional cookie or icecream isn't going to hurt. Stick to a regular eating schedule.</h3>
<br>
    <h2>Speak to a nutritional counselor</h2> <br>
    <h3>Eating more than you were or eating less than you were doesn't mean that you have recovered completely. A nutritional counselor or dietician will help you incorporate the right foods into your diet.</h3>
